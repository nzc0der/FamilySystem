   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nzc0der/FamilySystem.git
   cd FamilySystem
   ```

2. **Run the setup script**:
   The setup script will create a virtual environment, install dependencies, and prepare the configuration.
   ```bash
   python3 setup.py
   ```

---

##  First-Run Setup

After running the setup script, you will need to configure your admin user and basic settings.
1. Run the server: `python3 server.py`
2. Open your browser and navigate to the address shown in the terminal.
3. Follow the on-screen wizard to create your primary family account.

---

##  Configuring the systemd Service

To ensure the dashboard starts automatically when your Pi boots:

1. Copy the service file:
   ```bash
   sudo cp family_dashboard.service /etc/systemd/system/
   ```
2. Reload systemd and enable the service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl enable family_dashboard.service
   sudo systemctl start family_dashboard.service
   ```

---

##  Accessing the Dashboard

Once running, access the dashboard from any device on your local network:
- **URL**: `http://<your-pi-ip>:5000`
- **Default Port**: 5000 (configurable in `config.json`)

---

##  Backup & Recovery

The dashboard includes an automated backup system. Backups are stored in the `backups/` directory.

- **Manual Backup**: Run `python3 server.py --backup`
- **Restore**: Use the `reset_system.py` tool to restore from a specific snapshot.

---

##  Safe Manual Reset

If you need to wipe the system and start fresh:
```bash
python3 reset_system.py
```
*Warning: This will delete all user data and settings.*

---

##  Troubleshooting

- **Port already in use**: Check if another instance is running or change the port in `config.json`.
- **Permission Denied**: Ensure you have read/write permissions in the project folder.
- **Missing Dependencies**: Re-run `pip install -r requirements.txt` within your virtual environment.
